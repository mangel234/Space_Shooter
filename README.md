# SpaceShooter

 By: Sebastian, Miguel Nunez
 
We would like create a space invaders based app. The app will require animations, a UI that allows the user to properly maneuver and enjoy the game. 
Different patterns will need to be implemented for the space invaders to be able to pose a threat to the player's character. The user's character will need to fire projectiles in order to rid himself of the space invaders. 
Different types of space invaders will need to be defeated for certain levels and once you reach a certain point a boss space invader will appear. 
The boss space invader will be similar to the previously fought space invaders however will be a higher level opponent. Different levels and difficulties will need to be implemented as the player advances through the story. 
The player's character will also need more development to combat the difficulty of the new space invaders such as a shield, weapon upgrade, or weapon selection. 
This will be focused on by Miguel who will try to add different weapons and selection for the player by implementing the UI as well as some of the logic for hit detection.
Throughout each of these events the player will have a score to reflect how well he is doing and how many times he can use his abilities.
If the player were to kill a boss level space invader they will be able to obtain more points to their score and abilities. 
The movement for the spaceship will be based off of the android gyroscope system. This will be implemented by Sebastian who will try to limit the players movement to the lower portion of the screen as well as incoming enemies logic and randomize combat.  
Basically we will be utilizing this feature so if the player wants to move he/she will tilt their phone in the direction you want to move.
However they will only be able to move sideways on the screen. 
The projectile launcher will fire automatically, however the abilities will be activated by the user.
